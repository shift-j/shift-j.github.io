          shift J # shift J is an exploration into technical writing and the people who do that work. We explore technical communication, content strategy, and developer relations through the community of established professionals in all industries.
Founded in 2020 by Jerome Villegas and Jeremiah Telzrow, the two met after completing the certificate in professional technical writing through the UW Professional &amp;amp; Continuing Education program.
Since then, the two have had careers in technical communication in the Pacific Northwest.
